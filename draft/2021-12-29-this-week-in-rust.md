## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [kajiya](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya), an experimental real-time global illumination renderer made with Rust and Vulkan.

llogiq is pretty pleased with himself for this suggestion.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Unfortunately a change introduced in [rust-lang/rust#89836](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89836) has made performance across different compiler artifacts much more variable by embedding compiler version information (including a git commit hash) in demangled symbol names. This means that even if two compiler artifacts are built from the same exact source code (with only the git commit changed), the compiler will have slightly different performance characteristics. This makes comparisons across pull requests virtually impossible. 

The compiler team is still deciding what to do to handle this, but in the mean time, performance testing is largely broken. This issue is currently being tracked in[rust-lang/rustc-perf#1126](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1126).
